Hi!! 

I like building software that feels **reliable, private, and well thought out**.

Most of my projects start with a simple question:
“How would this feel if someone used it every day?”

---

### 🧠 What I enjoy working on

- Small tools that solve real problems
- Clean backend logic and data flow
- Security-aware designs (auth, access, isolation)
- Interfaces that don’t feel cluttered or loud

I care a lot about **clarity** — in code, UI, and system design.

---

### 🧩 What you’ll find here

This GitHub is a mix of:
- Personal projects I actually use
- Experiments while learning new concepts
- Systems I’ve built end-to-end, from idea to polish

Some projects evolve slowly. Others are quick builds.
All of them are intentional.

### 🌱 Currently exploring

- Secure application patterns
- Backend systems & APIs
- Cloud-ready project setups
- Better ways to structure personal software

✨ If something here catches your eye, feel free to explore the code. ✨
